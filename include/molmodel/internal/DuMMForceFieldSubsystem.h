/** @defgroup MMCustomTerms User defined molecular mechanics force terms
 *  @ingroup MolecularMechanics
 *
 * These classes are used with DuMMForceFieldSubsystem to permit user-defined 
 * functional forms for bonded terms.
 *
 * \b Basic features
 * - You can make custom bond stretch, bond bend, and bond torsion terms.
 * - Each term is represented by an abstract base class with a virtual 
 *   destructor.
 * - You write one scalar method to calculate energy and one to calculate force.
 * - You can associate multiple custom bond terms with the same atom classes; 
 *   in that case the terms are additive.
 * - You do not have to supply terms for every combination of atom classes that
 *   appears in your system; your methods will be called only for combinations 
 *   for which you have actually supplied a term.
 * - It is your responsibility to ensure that your force (or torque) method 
 *   returns the negative gradient of your energy method.
 *
 * \b Notes
 * - %DuMM may skip calling your function if the atoms all reside on the same 
 *   body; that can't affect the motion, but note that the internal energy will 
 *   not be counted in that case.
 * - %DuMM will take over ownership of the concrete object you supply to its
 *   defineCustomBond...() methods; don't delete them yourself.
 *
 * \b AmberTorsion example
 *
 * This demonstrates how the built-in Amber force might be applied as a custom 
 * torsion. This is a toy example because this particular form is already built
 * into DuMMForceFieldSubsystem.

 * This is \e not the Lennard-Jones term (half-) Sigma, which is the radius 
 * (half distance between atom centers) at which the energy crosses zero, 
 * that is, a little closer together than when the energy well is at maximum depth. 
 * To convert for Lennard-Jones: Rmin = 2^(1/6) * Sigma. NOTE: in many

/** @name                 Define atom categories
An AtomClass is used to collect together a set of properties which are expected
to be shared by many individual atoms. The properties are: the element (as 
atomic number), expected valence, and van der Waals parameters. Charge is not 
included in AtomClass but in a second more detailed classification level called
ChargedAtomType. **/

/** Define a new atom class for this force field, for identifying atoms of a 
particular element, number of bonds, and van der Waals parameters. You must
assign a unique index number and name, either of which can be used to 
reference this AtomClass subsequently. Typically the number and name
are defined by the force field you are using.
@param[in]      atomClassIx
    A unique integer index identifying this AtomClass.
@param[in]      atomClassName
    A unique string identifying this AtomClass.
@param[in]      atomicNumber
    The kind of element associated with this AtomClass, that is, the number of
    protons in the nucleus of atoms that are members of this class.
@param[in]      expectedValence
    The number of bonds expected for atoms in this class; this is a defining
    feature of the atom class so must be satisfied exactly. For example, this
    would be 4 for a class representing a tetrahedral carbon atom.
@param[in]      vdwRadiusInNm
    Van der Waals radius is given as Rmin, the \e radius (in nm, \e not A!) at
    which the energy well minimum is seen (actually it is 1/2 the distance 
    between atom centers for a pair of atoms of this class). This is \e not 
    Sigma, which we define as the \e radius (half distance) at which the 
    energy crosses zero, that is, a little closer together than when the 
    energy well is at maximum depth. See warning below.
@param[in]      vdwWellDepthInKJ
    This is the minimum energy value for the van der Waals force as a positive
    number in kJ/mol (\e not kcal/mol!). This is the value used in the 
    definition of the \a vdwRadiusInNm parameter.
    
@warning It is also common in force fields that van der Waals size terms are 
given by \e diameter rather than \e radius -- be sure you know what convention
was used by your source so that you can convert to radius here. To convert for
a Lennard-Jones force: Rmin = 2^(1/6)Sigma. The radius is in nm, the well 
depth in kJ/mol.

/** @name                   Bond torsion terms
Bond torsion (dihedral) parameters (for 4 atom classes bonded 1-2-3-4). You can
use the standard, built-in functional form (a combination of sinusoids) or 
define your own. Bond torsion terms produce energy and a scalar torque that 
are dependent only on the rotation angle about the 2-3 bond in the specified 
atom class sequence.

\b Theory

Label the four bonded atoms r-x-y-s. Rotation occurs about the axis v=y-x, that
is, a vector from x to y. We define a torsion angle theta using the "polymer 
convention" rather than the IUPAC one which is 180 degrees different. Ours is 
like this:
<pre>
            r                         r      s
  theta=0    \             theta=180   \    / 
              x--y                      x--y
                  \
                   s
</pre>
The sign convention is the same for IUPAC and polymer: A positive angle is 
defined by considering r-x fixed in space. Then using the right hand rule 
around v (that is, thumb points from x to y) a positive rotation rotates y->s 
in the direction of your fingers.

We use a periodic energy function like this:
<pre>
      E(theta) = sum E_n(1 + cos(n*theta - theta0_n))
</pre>
where n is the periodicity, E_n is the amplitude (kJ/mol) for term n, and 
theta0_n is the phase offset for term n. The torque term (applied about the 
v axis) is then
<pre>
      T(theta) = -[sum -n*E_n*sin(n*theta - theta0_n)]
</pre>

Note that in the functional forms above the amplitude paramter E_n could be 
considered a "half amplitude" since the total excursion of the energy and 
torque functions is 2*E_n. When entering this  parameter, be sure you 
understand whether the data you have represents the (half) amplitude as above
(most common) or the full excursion range of the function, in which case you 
should provide only 1/2 the excursion as the value for DuMM's amplitude 
parameter.

For a custom torsion bond, DuMM will provide the angle theta to the
user-written energy and torque routines, expecting a scalar value E(theta) and
T(theta) back as above. However, the functional form is specified by the user
in that case, and it is the user's responsibility to ensure that the returned
torque is the negative gradient of the energy with respect to the angle 
parameter theta.

In either case, DuMM takes care of translating the returned scalar torque
into an appropriate mobility torque when possible, or an appropriate set
of forces on each of the atoms r-x-y-s such that the desired pure torque is
realized as the resultant of the forces. **/

/** Define bond torsion terms applying to a quadruple of atom classes using the
built-in functional form, a combination of sinusoids with different periods
(see full discussion in the group header for bond torsion terms). You are only 
allowed to specify a built-in term of a given period once per class quadruple, 
whether specified 1-2-3-4 or 4-3-2-1. It is permitted to redefine the same term
as long as the parameters are the same both times, otherwise this method will 
throw an exception if (class1,class2,class3,class4) or (class4,class3,class2,
class1) has already been assigned. The amplitude of the energy functions must 
be given in (kJ/mol), the period is an integer which will multiply the dihedral
angle, and the phase (offset) angle is given in degrees (not radians). 
CAUTION: various conventions exist for specifying the parameters for bond 
torsion terms. Pay particular attention to the amplitude -- in our convention
it is really a half-amplitude since the sinusoids range from -1 to 1 making the
full energy and torque "excursion" twice the amplitude.
